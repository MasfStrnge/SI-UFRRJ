I will never promise to
I will never bother you
I will crawl away for good
You won't be afraid of fear
I always knew it would come to this
I have never failed to fail
Pain
You know you're right
You know you're right
I no longer have to hide
Steaming soup against her mouth
She just wants to love herself
You won't be afraid of fear
I always knew to come like this
I have never failed to fail
Pain
Pain
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know you're right
You know your rights
You know your rights
You know your rights
